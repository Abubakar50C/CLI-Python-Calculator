# CLI-Python-Calculator
A simple yet robust command line calculator built with python. Perfect for learning Python functions, loops, and conditionals.

**Features**
  - Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation.
  - Reusable functions for each operation.
  - Input validation and error handling: prevents crashes from invalid user input.
  - Interactive menu loop: allows multiple calculations in one session.
  - Data structure usage: stores valid operations in a list, tracks operation choice dynamically,
    and could be extended to store a history of calculations using a list of dictionaries.

**Installation**
  1. Clone the repository using "git clone https://github.com/Abubakar50C/CLI-Python-Calculator"
  2. Navigate to the project folder with cd CLI-Python-Calculator.
  3. Run the program by typing "python calc.py"

**Usage**
  - Run the program in your terminal.
  - Choose an operation from the menu: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Exponent, or Quit.
  - Enter numbers when prompted.
  - View the result.
  - Continue calculating until you choose Quit.

**Future Improvements**
  - Store a history of calculations.
  - Support more complex operations like square roots, logs, or trigonometry.
  - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PySimpleGUI.

**License**
  - This project is open source and free to use for learning and portfolio purposes.
